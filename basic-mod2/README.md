## Description

> A new modular challenge! Take each number mod 41 and find the modular inverse for the result. 
> Then map to the following character set: 1-26 are the alphabet, 27-36 are the decimal digits, and 37 is an underscore. 
> Wrap your decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format (i.e. picoCTF{decrypted_message})

## Hints

**1** : Do you know what the modular inverse is?
**2** : The inverse modulo z of x is the number, y that when multiplied by x is 1 modulo z
**3** : It's recommended to use a tool to find the modular inverses

## Solution

Solution of the challenge can be found [here](solution/).
